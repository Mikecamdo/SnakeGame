# SnakeGame

## Project Description
Using JFrame, ActionListener, File IO, and Object Oriented principles, this program is a simple recreation of the game Snake in Java. Features include keeping track of the user's current score, keeping track of the user's high score across all games, and being able to play multiple games without restarting the program.

## Instructions
The game starts when the program is launched, and the user controls the snake using the arrow keys. When the user passes over the red circles (the "food"), the snake expands in length by 1. The user's score is displayed on the screen. When the user dies (either by hitting their own body or by hitting the boundary), a "Game Over" message is displayed, as well as the user's score from the previous game and their high score (from all sessions played). The user's high score is stored in a persistent .txt file. The user can hit the "Enter" key to restart the game. The program ends when the exit button on the GUI is clicked.
